**Brexchange Business Plan** (draft)

our plan is to create an exchange that deals only with crypto coins, without fiat currency, with a focus on Brazilian currencies,
example: [zcore](https://www.zcore.cash/) [bzlcoin](http://site.bzlcoin.org/) [Niobio Cash](https://niobiocash.org/en/) 
these would be the first, we also want to put small coins in pair with NBR.

**target public**

Initially we would start in Brazil and other countries of Latin America, Brazil has more than 1 million investors in crypto-coins, but we want to reach all continents as we use crypto-coins we have no limits.

**Marketing Plan**

we can have a very active presence in social networks and eventually we can boost publications on Facebook, Twitter, Vk, to reach the specific public

**Hardware**

We have Dedicated Servers in Clouster with the following initial settings for the project
- BREX1 - Intel Core I3 (4 cores) 3.4 Ghz, 8GB RAM and 2TB HD
- BREX2 - Intel Xeon (8 cores) 2.66 Ghz, 16GB RAM and 2TB HD

**Right Now**

At this time we have installed the InfraexDev fork in a google VPS with 4cores and 5gb ram just to test, however we had problems trying to add a Bitcoin fork coin.
